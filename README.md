# Loan Status Prediction 
This project involves building a machine learning model to predict whether a loan application will be approved or not, based on applicant and loan-related information
The dataset used to do this project is too big, the link for the data is provided

Dependencies 
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn


- Comprehensive EDA with visualizations
- Data preprocessing and feature encoding
- Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest models
- Model evaluation using accuracy and confusion matrix

  Machine Learning Algorithms used
  - Logistic Regression: baseline linear model
- Decision Tree: interpretable tree-based model
- Random Forest: ensemble method for improved accuracy

  
#The Random Forest model achieved the highest accuracy (~XX%) and performed best in classifying approved vs. rejected applications.
